          Since beginning my discipleship walk with the Lord, I had had a desire to
          share the love of Christ with others. The purpose of this blog is to bring
          people closer in their relationship with Jesus, as well as give a glimpse
          of the nature of God as it's been revealed in Scripture. It is a collection
          of my personal a-ha! moments, as well as prayers of worship.
