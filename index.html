          Since beginning my discipleship walk with the Lord, I had had a desire to
          write a blog, sharing the love of Christ with others. The purpose of this
          blog is to bring people closer in their relationship with Jesus, as well
          as give a glimpse of the nature of God as it's been revealed in Scripture.
          Where once I found security in things and people, I find my security in
          Jesus Christ.
