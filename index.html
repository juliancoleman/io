          Since beginning my career as a software engineer and full-stack developer,
          I've gone from an HTML-CSS wombo combo developer, thinking I was so cool
          that I knew how to use floats, long before the revolution of <code>flex</code>
          and <code>grid</code>&mdash;certainly long before CSS variables, but we had
          SASS for such a thing&mdash;to becoming a seasoned JavaScript and Python
          engineer with experience in deliverables, production-level code, and teaching
          others to be more effective engineers. I thank God for the gifts and talents
          I get to use to honor Him on a daily basis.
